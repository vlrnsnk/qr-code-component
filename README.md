### What I Learned

I further improved my skills using Figma and Pixel Perfect design.

### Useful Resources

- [StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27612931/styling-html-and-body-selector-to-height-100-vs-using-100vh) - This thread helped me decide whether I should use `min-height: 100%` or `100vh`.
